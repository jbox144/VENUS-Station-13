  Bhijn & Myr:
  - code_imp: Barks can now be intercepted via component signals. Both bark queuing
      and individual barks can be intercepted via signals!
  - rscadd: The "Brassy" bark has been added, using the cog installation sound as
      a sample! This works surprisingly well as a bark
  - rscadd: Genetics can now give people goose1.ogg
  - tweak: If new barks are queued before the current barks are finished, this will
      interrupt all ongoing barks
  - tweak: Yelling no longer cuts the minimum bark time variance down to half, as
      this proved to sound pretty awful with most barks.
  - tweak: Chitter now uses a completely unique audio sample, which is based on the
      original ratchet.ogg it used to be. This new sample is shorter, and has significantly
      less harsh noise on the higher frequencies, making it much easier on the ears.
      Additionally, the minimum speed for chitter has been reduced from 6 to 4.
  - tweak: Setting vocal_bark to a file should now automatically turn it into a sound
      datum (in theory, at least! as of writing i haven't tested this at all)
  - bugfix: Barks and other DNA features after the first mob color now work exactly
      as you'd expect. This was the cause for horrid eldritch bark sounds when the
      wrong part of DNA gets hit. The first mob color has lost some genetics resolution
      as an indirect result of this (the higher resolution is what caused this bug)

  - rscadd: slimes no longer die from having no blood, properly consume limbs when
      at low blood, and suffer brute damage and oxygen loss for having no blood and
      no limbs left to consume respectably, they cannot go past BLOOD_VOLUME_MAXIMUM
      from consuming toxin

  SandPoot:

      your hand, no longer attempts to heat nothing, which caused immense amounts
      of runtimes.
  - bugfix: The syndicate has fixed the radiation health analyzer allowing you to
      check on the ui again.

      area.

      be clickable as long as they are clicking the tile it's on.

      open.
  - bugfix: Using wirecutters on an autolathe with an open panel will now have appropriate
      behavior of opening the wire menu.

      of acting like they got adminspawned.
