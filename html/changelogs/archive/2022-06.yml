      automatically turning it off in darkness when it is on and you have been in
      darkness for >= 0.2 seconds tweak: nyctophobia and lightless will both not update
      your mood until you move now, as part of the optimisations made by changing
      them to tg code'
2022-06-03:

  Bhijn & Myr:
  - rscadd: During pride month, station nukes are significantly more efficient at
      revealing genders.
  - rscadd: Station pets now retain their color between shifts!
  - bugfix: Admin vote deobfuscation now properly displays votes as 0 if they were
      simply never voted for.
  - bugfix: Audiovisual redirection now works exactly as it used to. In laymen's terms,
      this means folks in VR sleepers are aware of the world around them again!
  - bugfix: The shake animation, jiggle animation, squish animation, jitter animation,
      and float animation, have all been fixed.
  - bugfix: This also means that storage animations are fully working again. It's
      been a few years!
  - bugfix: The pull animation no longer interrupts ongoing animations.
  - tweak: The pull animation now supports diagonal directions (currently only applies
      to the initial grab! pull code is spaghetti)
  - bugfix: All screenshake sources now fully support the screenshake pref
  - code_imp: cit_screenshake.dm has been fully merged into the base files.
  - bugfix: You can no longer remotely apply fingerprints to storage objects by clicking
      and dragging it around. Additionally, storage objects now rustle again when
      clicking and dragging (only took like,, a year to fix)
  - bugfix: The pickup animation now properly slides into your spaceman again, instead
      of just kinda disappearing.
  - tweak: When pulling a resting mob, they'll now skip the laying animation entirely,
      fixing a visual oddity where they shrink and grow to flip.
  - tweak: Alerts are now a little snappier and bouncier, as they've been swapped
      from sine easing, to back easing.
  - tweak: Radial menus now use sine easing, rather than linear easing. This just
      looks a little prettier.
  - tweak: Runechat now properly respects an object's X offset. Previously, it relied
      on a hardcoded check for dogborgs.
  - tweak: The float animation now uses pixel_z instead of pixel_y, fixing issues
      where the Y offset gets wiped due to the float animation. This also makes floating
      fully compatible with ctrl+WASD."

2022-06-11:
  Bhijn & Myr:
  - rscadd: The station minimap now features higher detail! Instead of just windows
      and grilles being outlined, all dense+anchored structures and machinery are
      shown on the minimap.
  - rscadd: The station minimap now supports obfuscating entire areas, via the minimap_show_walls
      var.
  - rscadd: 'The station minimap now supports defining two area colors, allowing for
      a checkerboard pattern! tweak: Hallways and maint have been given white and
      gray colors, respectively, for ease of readability. tweak: Ruins are now obfuscated
      on the minimap, and have been given a subtle, yet distinct, color pattern!'
  - bugfix: The station minimap no longer errors when you mouse over it
  - rscadd: 'The station minimap now supports multiz! (However, due to bugginess,
      multiz minimaps won''t display area tooltips.) tweak: The station minimap now
      features pixel-perfect scaling.'
  - code_imp: The station minimap can now support managing data for up to 16,581,374
      areas without any conflicts at all! Before, BYOND's psuedorandom RNG meant that
      it was somewhat common for areas to collide with each others' data.
  - rscadd: Talking is now accompanied with fully-customizable sounds! You can modify
      your character's speech under the speech tab in chargen, and you can toggle
      these sounds via the "Hear/Silence Vocal Barks" verb under the preferences tab!
      This also fully supports genetics.
  - bugfix: Admittedly an unatomized change, but Cit's DNA blocks can now properly
      be updated through genetics. Before, these required a complete genetics reset
      to apply.
  - rscadd: 'The chat now supports blockquotes! tweak: Examining, medical scanners,
      self-checking, and mood checkups, have all been converted to make use of blockquotes.'
  Bhijn & Myr (+ UI work and cleanup by Sandpoot!):
  - rscadd: Colormates now have HSV coloration!
  - tweak: Colormates have had their "please use white clothing" message removed,
      as that recommendation's now mostly pointless
  - tweak: The default mode for colormates is now HSV coloration
  - tweak: The temp messages in colormates have been tweaked slightly to be more user-friendly,
      as they're user-facing.
  - tweak: The description for constants in the colormate matrix mode has been fixed;
      the constant variables have nothing to do with contrast, they simply add color
  - tweak: Matrix mode has been made a lot more usable; it's now clamped between -10
      and 10, and features a step of 0.01, making it much easier to simply click and
      drag to adjust the values, rather than having to punch them in manually
  Putnam3145:
  - balance: QCD matter is now worth 10x as much and makes 2 research pointer per
      mole
  SandPoot:
  - rscadd: Added a search box to all vending machine uis.

  - bugfix: Now you can actually give your character numbers in their names and species
  - bugfix: Gives the syntech ring and band an actual ring path so they can be attached
      to gloves (doesn't work if you use them this way tho)
  - bugfix: Definitely fixes the bug where spawning with more than one size normalizer
      locks you on size one _in case it still exists_
  - bugfix: "Fixes a bug with nanites, probably \xBF"
  - code_imp: Makes the size normalizer code less snowflakey and now relies on a component
2022-06-13:

      base

  - spellcheck: Fixed an incorrect step displayed on spout glassworking
  - code_imp: Enables the make priority announcement admin verb for admin use
2022-06-20:
  Bhijn & Myr:
  - balance: Ling abilities now have a default loudness of 0.5. This change applies
      to every single ability that used to have 0 loudness.
  TrojanCoyote:
  - rscadd: Adds a plate carrier to HoS loadout, sprites for such
2022-06-21:
  WoolyAypa:
  - rscadd: 'Added a new +3 points worth quirk: Dumb4Cum'
2022-06-22:
  Bhijn & Myr:
  - code_imp: Barks can now be intercepted via component signals. Both bark queuing
      and individual barks can be intercepted via signals!
  - rscadd: The "Brassy" bark has been added, using the cog installation sound as
      a sample! This works surprisingly well as a bark
  - rscadd: Genetics can now give people goose1.ogg
  - tweak: If new barks are queued before the current barks are finished, this will
      interrupt all ongoing barks
  - tweak: Yelling no longer cuts the minimum bark time variance down to half, as
      this proved to sound pretty awful with most barks.
  - tweak: Chitter now uses a completely unique audio sample, which is based on the
      original ratchet.ogg it used to be. This new sample is shorter, and has significantly
      less harsh noise on the higher frequencies, making it much easier on the ears.
      Additionally, the minimum speed for chitter has been reduced from 6 to 4.
  - tweak: Setting vocal_bark to a file should now automatically turn it into a sound
      datum (in theory, at least! as of writing i haven't tested this at all)
  - bugfix: Barks and other DNA features after the first mob color now work exactly
      as you'd expect. This was the cause for horrid eldritch bark sounds when the
      wrong part of DNA gets hit. The first mob color has lost some genetics resolution
      as an indirect result of this (the higher resolution is what caused this bug)
2022-06-23:
  BongaTheProto:
  - soundadd: New Gaster and Mettaton barks
2022-06-26:
