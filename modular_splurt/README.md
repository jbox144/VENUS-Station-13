# About modularizing defines

Since #define clauses can't be properly modularized and need to be loaded first than the rest of the code for it to catch them, the modular_splurt/code/_DEFINES/ folder has been deleted and all of its contents have been moved to code\\__SPLURTCODE\\DEFINES

Please use this folder the same way you'd use the _DEFINES folder once found inside this directory
